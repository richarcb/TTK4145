# Driver

This module contains hardware driver code necessary for communication between elevators and program. The driver code lets us manage the elevator's behavior such as motor direction, lights, etc. The code in this module is written by [TTK4145](https://github.com/TTK4145) and can be found [here](https://github.com/TTK4145/driver-go). We have made some minor changes to the code to make it suit our system better, but it is mostly the equal to the original module.
