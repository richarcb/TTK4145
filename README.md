# Elevator Project TTK4145

Real time programming, written in golang.


Terminal commands:
* go run main.go 15657
* ./SimElevatorServer --port 15657


## Problem Description

In this project, we create a program for controlling x elevators with y floors. The elevators communicate over network, where information is _
UDP broadcasted.

The following requirements should be met:

* Multiple elevators are more efficient than one
* The lights and buttons should function as expected
* No orders are lost
* An individual elevator should behave sensibly and efficiently

## Our solution
